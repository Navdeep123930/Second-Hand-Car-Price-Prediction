# Second-Hand-Car-Price-Prediction
The objective of this project is to build a model using keras which can predict the selling price of a used car
I build a model based on multiple features such as top speed,hp,torque,on road old,on road now,years,km,rating,condition,economy to predict the price of second hand car
In this project we applied various Python tools to get a better visual understanding of the data
The Data was extracted from a famous Kaggle Second Hand Car Price Prediction Competition
This project uses the following software and libraries:
1. Python
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras
4. pandas
5. matplotlib
6. seaborn etc...

Thank You
